The byz-prsd was replaced by byz-prsd-new by Robinson.
Changes:
    date 1995/0701 -> 1996/03/21
    Change parse numbers for several verb forms 890x -> 590x.
	This mostly affected forms of DEIN, PREPEIN, ECESTI, MELEI, EXON, KAQHKONTA.
    Fix about 8 garbled brace/parse errors.
    Docs comment on changes.

The byz-prsd-new -> byz-prsd-new-corr changes were my own:
    Split/join INATI.
    Fix garbled braces/numbers.
    Add missing parsings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The greeknt.mrp is from CCAT.

The greeknt.mrp2 differs from the previous by the patch morphGNT.diff from tauber.
    The patch fixes parsing errors due to machine parsing, mostly in the lemmas.

The tauber-gnt-morph.1 comes from tauber, described in mail below.
    Changes from greeknt.mrp2 to tauber-gnt-morph.1 :
    add fields as mentioned in the mail below.
    Changed case from *lower to Upper.
    parsing put person of verbs as first letter, not 4th.
    Correct lemmas for: ZWNAS, MARTURIA, APOSTOLHS, KAISAREIAN,
	AREION PAGON, PORNOIS, MARANA QA, EQELOQRHSKIA,
	EIDWLOLATRIAIS.
    Correct part of speech for ANWTERON, KAKOPOIWN, AGAQOPOIWN.

The tauber-gnt-morph.2 differs from .1 in the correction of garbled
    words of text from the three editions.  They should have been
    equal in all three columns, because all come from NA26.
    These are the problem triplets that were made consistent.

The tauber-gnt-morph.3 differs from .2 in the following changes:
    Delete $1 ... $ font change marks.
    Change [1 ... ]1 parenthesis marks to { ... } .
    Move a smooth breathing in word 67795?
    Change Uppercase to *lowercase.
    Delete @ tab character.
    Change the single-char parts of speech to have a trailing
	hyphen, so that all fields are separated by one space,
	but can still line up.
